    Afghanistan was among the most contested, protested, and debated wars. It has many simultaneous causes and reasons for not being too happy with an ending. However, it helped accomplish many different agendas and tasks the United States needed to take care of. The Afghanistan War was a necessary war for the U.S. because it involved many terrorist attacks, it was one of the more modern wars, and it was to stomp out terrorism in the entire world. 


	The Afghanistan war originated in 2001 when the infamous terrorist group AL Qaeda launched its major terrorist attack on the united states on September 11. Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden had been obsessed with destroying the United States and its world trade center. To execute such an attack, he had sent multiple hijackers to different airports around the country, all destined for important United States landmarks such as the World Trade Center, The Pentagon, and The White House. AL Qaeda's attack, for the most part, was successful; however, this shocked the United States as a country. The United States, from that day on, had made it their mission for them to hunt down all of Al Qeada and bring them to justice and make sure that each of their members paid the price for their actions. The United States had called this operation the war on terror, and the day Congress approved it, Al Qeada had hidden out and tried to conceal a low identity. 

	As the years passed, the United States eventually gained intel on wherever Al Qeada was hiding, such as Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, etc. Al Qeada soon ran out of countries to hide in until they sought shelter in Afghanistan. At the time, the Taliban was not in complete control of Afghanistan, and they were slowly emerging to be its permanent government, and the United States had decided not to interfere in the matter; however, when the Taliban heard of Al Qeada hiding out in Afghanistan, they had offered to shelter them from the United States and to train their troops the United States became angry. President George Bush addressed it in a speech. "Tonight, we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom. Our grief has turned to anger and anger to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done.  ”(Bush). "Americans have many questions tonight. Americans are asking:  Who attacked our country? The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations known as al Qaeda. They are the same murderers indicted for bombing American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya and responsible for bombing the USS Cole.
Al Qaeda is to terrorize what the mafia is to crime. However, its goal is not to make money but to remake the world and impose its radical beliefs on people everywhere.
The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics -- a fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam. The terrorists' directive commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans, and make no distinction between military and civilians, including women and children.
This group and its leader, Osama bin Laden, are linked to many other organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. There are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries. They are recruited from their nations and neighborhoods and brought to camps in places like Afghanistan, where they are trained in terror tactics. They are sent back to their homes or to hide in countries around the world to plot evil and destruction.
”(Bush). According to President Bush's speech, he addressed the root cause of all the attacks as these terrorist organizations. He had even spoken a few brief words about his mission in Afghanistan.

Next, the United States, upon declaring war on Afghanistan they had wanted to take out terrorism as a whole and make sure that something like 9/11 would never happen again in any country for a fact above President Bush's Speech, he said that terrorist groups like Al Qeada Egyptian Islamic jihad, etc. have thousands upon thousands of active terrorists and subset organizations in other countries all acting for one big event more significant than or equal to the effects of 9/11. This made Afghanistan a necessary war because the United States needed to ensure they could hunt down the root cause for this middle eastern drama terrorism. Additionally, the United States had an even bigger target among all of this, the Taliban. The Taliban and a terrorist government defiant organization wanted to overthrow Afghanistan and take over the thought that they would lead the country to success through imperialism and brute force. At first, the United States did not see the Taliban as a threat until they harbored a dangerous terrorist organization Al Qaeda. So while the United States spent time in, it had to oust the Taliban.


  	Finally, the Afghanistan war is essential because it is a relative.
 Modern war from 2001-2021 can show just how important this can be to the United States' future relations. During that time, many different presidents had come through and tried their best to resolve the crisis in Afghanistan asap so that the United States could not be involved in more direct conflicts with the Middle East. This also meant more geopolitical conflicts for the United States, higher oil prices, and worse relationships as the war continued.
The Afghanistan War was a critical war for the United States because it focused on terrorism, is one of the most recent modern-day wars, and was made to stop a significant problem; terrorism. Although the Afghanistan War ended in a partial loss for the United States, its effects on us continue.
